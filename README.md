# Julia - MovieDB - DAZN Frontend Coding Challenge

Objective: Build a UI to search the Movie DB: The user should be able to enter some text into a search field see and browse the results from the Movie DB. Anything else it does it up to you!

## Getting Started

### Installing

To run in development mode:
```
npm install
```
```
npm start
```

This should automatically open the browser for you.

## Running the unit tests
```
npm run test
```
### Test coverage
```
npm run test:coverage
```
There is only one test file due to time contraints, however, it shows my general approach to unit testing.
